                    <p>
                        Robert "Bob" Belcher, Jr. is a figure following 
                        a family tradition in the restaurant business, 
                        and he serves as the main character in the Fox 
                        animated series Bob's Burgers. He manages the 
                        Bob's Burgers establishment, an operation he runs 
                        alongside his wife, Linda Belcher, and their 
                        three children: Tina, Gene, and Louise Belcher.

                    <h4>Linda</h4>

                    <p>
                        Linda Belcher (née Genarro) is the happy-go-lucky, 
                        eccentric wife of Bob Belcher and the mother of 
                        Tina, Gene, and Louise Belcher. Linda has a broad 
                        sense of humor, constantly joking with her family 
                        and friends. She is wise and kind to her family 
                        and loves them very much. She co-owns Bob's 
                        Burgers with her husband and helps run the 
                        restaurant for him when he's busy or away.

                    <h4>Tina</h4>

                    <p>
                        Tina is the oldest child of Bob and Linda. 
                        Her siblings are Gene and Louise. She's
                        always had terrible vision and wore glasses 
                        since she was a baby.

                    <h4>Gene</h4>

                    <p>
                        Eugene "Gene" Belcher is the middle child of Bob and 
                        Linda Belcher. He is the only boy out of the three 
                        siblings. Gene is an aspiring musician and a 
                        prankster. He maintains very close relationships with 
                        both of his parents and two sisters, Tina and Louise
                        Belcher. Gene, along with Tina, is usually a pawn in 
                        schemes set up by Louise. He attends Wagstaff School 
                        with his siblings as a sixth grader.

                    <h4>Louise</h4>

                    <p>
                        Louise Belcher is the third child and youngest daughter 
                        of Bob and Linda Belcher. Her off-balance sense of humor 
                        and hunger for conflict makes her somewhat of a liability 
                        in the kitchen and often gets her family both into and/or 
                        out of tricky situations. Like her siblings, Tina and 
                        Gene Belcher, Louise goes to Wagstaff School, where she 
                        is a fourth grader.
